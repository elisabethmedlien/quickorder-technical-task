# my decisions
- I decided that the first row of the uploaded file will always be the table header

# my issues
- new to angular
- fairly new to typescript
(these issues were most time consuming for me)

# what I would want to fix if I had more time
- I am using the any type. I would with more time and research replace them by actual types. Either custom defined type objects or already existing types
- The file structure. 

# TODO
- clean up code (any types ++)
- structure code better. **COMPONENTS
