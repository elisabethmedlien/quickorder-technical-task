## my decisions
- I decided that the first row of the uploaded file will always be the table header

## my issues
- new to angular
- fairly new to typescript
(these issues were most time consuming for me)

## what I would want to fix if I had more time
- I am using the any type. I would with more time and research replace them by actual types. Either custom defined type objects or already existing types
- The file structure. 

## TODO
- clean up code (any types ++)
- structure code better. **COMPONENTS

# Code assignment

## Introduction
Code assignment
With this test we want to assess the level of your programming skills. Focus on writing clean and structured code. Your work will be examined as a combination of, feature completion, code quality and code structure.
This assignment is not supposed to take more than 4 hours, and can be completed in less, since we don’t want to take up too much of your time. Should you not be done in 4 hours, feel free to turn in the assignment. You will not be penalized for not finishing, if the quality of the delivered project is justified in 4 hours.
Feel free to ask questions, if anything is unclear.

## Task description
The task is to implement a small web application, using angular, that is able to parse a CSV/Excel file and convert it into a table that can be displayed to the user in the browser.
The user of the application should be able to upload an Excel file (multi sheet or single sheet) or a CSV file, which gets transformed to a JSON object, which can then be rendered in a table in the HTML of the angular application.
The individual sheets of the Excel file should be represented as individual tables each residing in it’s own tab in a tab group. Single sheet Excel files and CSV files should be represented as a single tab in a tab group.
Visually it should look decent, which means it shouldn’t be plain HTML, but you don’t have to overdo the styling. You can use any css framework, if that’s what you prefer.
Feel free to use any existing open source libraries e.g. npm packages.

## Requirements
● Frontend framework is Angular (latest stable version).
● Able to parse and display both multi- and single sheet Excel files and CSV files.
● Should look decent.

## Delivery
Deliver the end result however you prefer, the only requirement here is that we should be able to set it up and run it. Meaning you are free to deliver as a zip-file, google drive link, via your personal git repository etc.
